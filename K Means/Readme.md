# K Means Algorithm
In this code Centroids are selected randomly. The program will take two inputs: a data file (data.csv) containing multiple (at least 3) continuous features and a value for k. 
- The clustering process will continue until cluster-assignments/centroids do not change or a maximum of 100 iterations have been completed. 
- The program will add a new column containing cluster ids (1, 2, 3, â€¦, k) to the original input file and save it to clustered_data.csv, where k is the number of clusters.
